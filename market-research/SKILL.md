# Market Research Agent

## Overview

This skill conducts structured, web-powered market research to produce actionable intelligence for product and business decisions. It goes beyond surface-level summaries by triangulating multiple sources, quantifying market dynamics, and surfacing non-obvious insights.

The skill is designed for product leaders and founders who need to make decisions fast — not academic researchers who need exhaustive literature reviews.

## Core Principles

1. **Data over opinions**: Every claim should be backed by a source, a number, or a clear reasoning chain. Flag when something is an estimate vs. a verified figure.
2. **So-what framing**: Every finding should connect to a decision or action. Don't just report that "the market is growing" — say what that means for the user's specific situation.
3. **Honest uncertainty**: Clearly distinguish between verified facts, reasonable estimates, and speculation. Use confidence levels (High / Medium / Low) for key claims.
4. **Bootstrapper-friendly**: Default to scrappy, actionable insights rather than consulting-firm-style frameworks that require massive budgets to act on.
5. **Recency matters**: Always prefer recent data. Flag when data is older than 12 months. Use web search aggressively to find the latest numbers.

## Research Modes

The skill supports several research modes depending on what the user needs. Identify which mode(s) apply based on the user's request, then follow the corresponding workflow.

### Mode 1: Market Sizing (TAM / SAM / SOM)

**When to use**: User wants to understand how big an opportunity is. Phrases like "how big is the market for X", "what's the TAM", "is this market worth entering".

**Workflow**:
1. **Define the market boundaries** — What exactly are we measuring? Clarify geography, customer segment, product category.
2. **Top-down sizing** — Search for industry reports, analyst estimates, and public company data to establish TAM.
3. **Bottom-up validation** — Estimate from unit economics: (number of potential customers) × (average revenue per customer) × (purchase frequency).
4. **SAM narrowing** — Apply realistic filters: geography, segment, channel, price point.
5. **SOM estimation** — Based on competitive dynamics, distribution advantages, and realistic capture rate for a bootstrapped/early-stage company.
6. **Growth trajectory** — CAGR, key growth drivers, potential headwinds.

**Output format**:
```

### Mode 2: Competitive Landscape

**When to use**: User wants to understand who they're competing with. Phrases like "who are the competitors", "competitive analysis", "how does X compare to Y".

**Workflow**:
1. **Identify the competitive set** — Direct competitors, indirect competitors, and substitutes. Search broadly first, then narrow.
2. **Profile each competitor** — Funding, revenue (if available), team size, pricing, positioning, key features, target customer.
3. **Map the landscape** — Find meaningful axes to differentiate (e.g., price vs. depth, self-serve vs. enterprise, generalist vs. specialist).
4. **Identify gaps and patterns** — Where is the market underserved? What are competitors ignoring? Where is there convergence?
5. **Assess competitive moats** — Network effects, data advantages, brand, switching costs, distribution.

**Output format**:
```
## Competitive Landscape: [Market/Category]

### Competitive Set
| Company | Type | Founded | Funding/Revenue | Pricing | Target Segment | Key Differentiator |
|---------|------|---------|-----------------|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| ...     | Direct / Indirect / Substitute | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Positioning Map

### Mode 3: Customer & Segment Analysis

**When to use**: User wants to understand who buys and why. Phrases like "who's the target customer", "customer segments", "buyer persona", "willingness to pay".

**Workflow**:
1. **Identify segments** — Search for how the market naturally segments (by company size, role, use case, geography, behavior).
2. **Profile each segment** — Size, pain points, current solutions, budget, decision-making process, channels to reach them.
3. **Assess attractiveness** — Score each segment on: size, growth, accessibility, willingness to pay, competition intensity, strategic fit.
4. **Prioritize** — Recommend which segments to target first and why, using a beachhead market framework.

**Output format**:
```
## Customer Segments: [Market]

### Segment Overview
| Segment | Size | Key Pain Point | Current Solution | WTP | Accessibility | Priority |
|---------|------|----------------|------------------|-----|---------------|----------|
| ...     | ...  | ...            | ...              | ... | ...           | High/Med/Low |

### Priority Segment Deep Dive: [Top Segment]
- **Profile**: [demographics, firmographics]

### Mode 4: Pricing Research

**When to use**: User wants to understand how to price. Phrases like "how should I price", "pricing strategy", "what are others charging", "willingness to pay".

**Workflow**:
1. **Map competitor pricing** — Collect all visible pricing from competitors (tiers, models, discounts).
2. **Identify pricing models** — Freemium, subscription, one-time, usage-based, cohort-based, tiered.
3. **Analyze value metrics** — What unit does the customer care about? Per user, per project, per outcome?
4. **Assess price sensitivity** — Based on segment, alternatives, and switching costs.
5. **Recommend pricing architecture** — Model, tiers, anchor pricing, and positioning.

### Mode 5: Opportunity Assessment

**When to use**: User is evaluating whether to enter a market or launch a product. This is the most comprehensive mode — it combines elements of all other modes into a go/no-go brief.

**Workflow**:
1. Run a condensed version of Market Sizing (Mode 1)
2. Run a condensed version of Competitive Landscape (Mode 2)
3. Assess timing — Why now? What's changed?
4. Evaluate fit — Does this align with the user's strengths, assets, and distribution?

## Research Execution Guidelines

### Web Search Strategy
- **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with category-level searches, then drill into specifics.
- **Triangulate**: Never rely on a single source for market size or growth figures. Cross-reference at least 2-3 sources.
- **Prioritize primary sources**: Company blogs, SEC filings, press releases, and official reports over aggregator sites.
- **Search for contrarian views**: After finding the consensus, actively search for "why [market] is overhyped" or "[competitor] problems" to get the full picture.
- **Check recency**: Always note the date of data. Markets can shift dramatically in 12 months.
- **Use Indian context where relevant**: If the user's market is India, search for India-specific data, pricing, and competitive dynamics rather than defaulting to US/global data.

### Quality Checks
Before delivering any research output, verify:
- [ ] All market size figures have sources cited
- [ ] Competitor data is current (within 12 months)
- [ ] Confidence levels are assigned to key claims
- [ ] "So What" section connects findings to user decisions
- [ ] Honest about gaps: clearly state what you couldn't find or verify
- [ ] Numbers pass the smell test (e.g., a niche B2B market probably isn't $100B)

### Handling Uncertainty
- If reliable data doesn't exist, say so explicitly rather than guessing.
- For estimates, show your math so the user can adjust assumptions.
- Use ranges rather than point estimates when data is sparse: "₹500Cr - ₹800Cr based on [methodology]"
- Flag emerging markets where historical data may not predict the future.

## Adapting to Context

### For Bootstrapped Founders
- Emphasize unit economics and capital efficiency over total market size
- Focus on segments reachable without massive marketing budgets
- Highlight organic distribution channels and community-driven growth
- Consider the "1,000 true fans" angle for niche markets

### For Product Managers at Companies
- Frame findings in terms of product strategy and roadmap implications
- Connect market dynamics to feature prioritization
- Include build-vs-buy-vs-partner analysis where relevant
- Map competitive features to user needs

### For Investors/Fundraising Context
- Lead with TAM/SAM/SOM with clear methodology
- Emphasize growth vectors and timing
- Include comparable company analysis
- Frame competitive landscape as "why this team can win"

## Output Delivery

### Always ask the user which format they want

Before producing a research deliverable, ask the user what output format they want. Do not assume, and do not default to a file. The same research is consumed very differently depending on whether it is meant to be read, shared, presented, or version-controlled.

| Format | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| **Artifact** (rendered web page) | Reading and sharing a link. Strong choice for briefs and assessments meant to be read by a person. |
| **Markdown file** | Version control, diffing, feeding into other tools, updating over time. |
| **Word or PDF** | Circulating to leadership, a board, or external parties. |
| **Slide deck** | Presenting findings live. |
| **Chat only** | Quick reads where no file is wanted. |

Ask early — before doing the writing, not after it. If the user has already stated a preference anywhere in the conversation, honour it and don't ask again.

### Exception: quick questions
If the user asks a narrow, specific question (e.g., "what's the CAGR for edtech in India?"), answer directly with sources. Don't ask about format and don't produce a full report.

### Where to save files
Never write research output into the skill's own directory. A skill definition is reusable instructions; a research report is a dated one-off artifact of running them. Mixing the two means the skill package silently accumulates unrelated reports, and anyone installing the skill drags them along. Ask the user where the file should go, or default to a location clearly separate from the skill.

### For complex research
If the research requires more than one mode, produce a single comprehensive document that flows logically rather than separate reports. Use the Opportunity Assessment (Mode 5) format as the wrapper.
